It includes commercially sold electricity, both on and off the grid. For those countries where access to electricity has been assessed through government surveys, it also includes self-generated electricity.  ",,,,Years Covered and Frequency of Update:,,"Data are for the year 2005.  The data were taken from World Energy Outlook 2006. Though the International Energy Agency (IEA) publishes an updates World Energy Outlook every two years, 2002 was the first year for which the statistics on access to electricity were compiled. The 2006 edition incorporates the latest available information. Several major revisions have been made since the 2002 World Energy Outlook, notably for Brazil, India, Iraq,",,Ethiopia and Yemen. ,,,,Methodology:,,"Basic energy statistics are collected by the IEA from a variety of sources. In OECD member countries, national administrations fill out five annual questionnaires. In non-OECD countries, statistics are collected from questionnaires, international organizations such as United Nations, co-operation with national statistical bodies, and direct communication with energy consultants and companies. If data are not available from any of these sources, they are estimated by the IEA. Full details on the methodology used is available from the 2002 edition of the World Energy Outlook at http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/.",,,,Data Reliability and Cautionary Notes:,,The International Energy Agency has validated each data point through consultation with several data sources and experts and thus the data can be considered reliable. ,,,,Source,,International Energy Agency (IEA). 2006.

Washington, DC: The World Bank. Available at: http://go.worldbank.org/U0FSM7AQ40.",,,,,,,,,Technical Notes,,,Adapted from the World Bank's World Development Indicators,,,,,,Definition:,,,Percent gross domestic product (GDP) from agriculture represents the proportion of an economy's total domestic output of goods and services which are a result of value added by the agricultural sector.,,, ,,,Years Covered and Frequency of Update:,,,"The World Bank publishes the World Development Indicators each April and makes adjustments to this data in its online database throughout the year as necessary. As of 2008, data are available annually from 1960 to 2006.",,,,,,Methodology:,,,"Percent gross domestic product (GDP) from agriculture is calculated as the proportion of total output of goods and services which are a result of the value added by the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector corresponds to International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) divisions 1‰ÛÒ5 and includes forestry, hunting, and fishing, as well as cultivation of crops and livestock production. Value added is the value of the gross output of producers less the value of intermediate goods and services consumed in production. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources.",,,,,,"To produce national accounts aggregates that are measured in the same standard monetary units, the value of output must be converted to a single common currency. The World Bank conventionally uses the U.S. dollar and applies the average official exchange rate reported by the International Monetary Fund for the year shown. An alternative conversion factor is applied if the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to transactions in foreign currencies and traded products.",,,,,,"Country data are obtained directly from the World Bank without manipulation. However, WRI computes regional and income-based aggregates. WRI's regional definitions differ from those of the World Bank, as such, the regional averages will also differ. Income aggregates are based on the current income-group membership unlike those calculated by the World Bank, which are based on membership during the year of data reported. WRI does not use interpolation or any other statistical method to account for countries for which there is no data. Therefore aggregations may be less accurate than those done by agencies who use these statistical methods.",,,,,,Data Reliability:,,,"The World Bank produces the most reliable global GDP estimates available. However, it should be noted that these data do not account for differences in purchasing power To see national accounts data without these differences, see PPP (purchasing power parity) estimates.",,,,,,Among the difficulties faced by compilers of national accounts is the extent of unreported economic activity in the informal or secondary economy. In developing countries a large share of agricultural output is either not exchanged (because it is consumed within the household) or not exchanged for money.,,,,,,"Agricultural production often must be estimated indirectly, using a combination of methods involving estimates of inputs, yields, and area under cultivation. This approach sometimes leads to crude approximations that can differ from the true values over time and across crops for reasons other than climatic conditions or farming techniques. Similarly, agricultural inputs that cannot easily be allocated to specific outputs are frequently ""netted out"" using equally crude and ad hoc approximations.",,,

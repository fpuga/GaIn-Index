In reality, a portion of this water may be inaccessible to humans. Actual renewable water resources are defined as the sum of internal renewable resources (IRWR) and external renewable resources (ERWR), taking into consideration the quantity of flow reserved to upstream and downstream countries through formal or informal agreements or treaties and possible reduction of external flow due to upstream water abstraction.",,,,,,"Internal renewable water resources (IRWR) are comprised of the average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater (aquifers) generated from endogenous (internal) precipitation. Even though IRWR measures a combination of surface and groundwater resources, it is typically less than the sum of the two because of overlap--water resources that are common to both surface and groundwater.",,,,,,External renewable water resources (ERWR) are the portion of the country‰Ûªs renewable water resources which is not generated within the country. The ERWR include inflows from upstream,,,"countries (groundwater and surface water), and part of the water of border lakes or rivers.",,,,,,"Per capita water resources are calculated by WRI using 2006 and 2007 population estimates from the United Nations Population Division.

The current AQUASTAT database provides data per 5-year period if available. Data are presented by WRI as a single value for 1960-2007 because, for this variable, AQUASTAT lists only one number for each country over the entire time period covered by the database.",,,,,,"AQUASTAT updates their website as new data become available, or when FAO conducts special regional studies.",,,,,,"Please note that the AQUASTAT database also contains estimates of per capita actual renewable water resources that include estimates for most countries for most 5-year periods prior to the values published here; population estimates used in per capita calculations, however, may differ.",,,,,,Methodology:,,,"Per capita actual water resources were calculated by WRI using the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision.  For more information about the collection methodology and reliability of the UN population data, please refer to the EarthTrends technical notes on population.",,,,,,The computation of actual renewable water resources requires the assessment of both internal and external water resources.,,,,,,"Internal renewable water resources are computed by adding up average annual surface runoff and groundwater recharge occurring within a country's borders. Surface water resources are usually computed by measuring or assessing total river flow occurring in a country on a yearly basis.  Groundwater resources are estimated by measuring rainfall in arid areas where rainfall is assumed to infiltrate into aquifers. In humid areas, groundwater is estimated by looking at the surface flow of rivers. Special care is taken to avoid double counting resources that are common to both surface and groundwater, called overlap. Two types of exchanges create overlap: contribution of aquifers to surface flow, and recharge of aquifers by surface runoff. ",,,,,,"External flows include both natural and actual incoming flows. Natural incoming flow is the average amount of water which would flow into the country without human influence. Actual incoming flow is the average annual quantity of water entering the country, taking into account extraction by upstream countries.  It also accounts for the portion of the flow secured through treaties or agreements. The figure may vary with time.  It may be negative when the flow reserved to downstream countries is more than the incoming flow. Actual flows in humid countries are likely to be close to natural flows because of low water consumption relative to available resources in these countries. Conversely, in arid and semi-arid countries, the actual flows are much lower than natural flows.",,,,,,"AQUASTAT collects its information from a number of sources--national water resources and irrigation master plans; national yearbooks, statistics and reports; reports from FAO; international surveys; and, results from surveys made by national or international research centers. In most cases, the information was analyzed to ensure consistency between the different data collected for a given country.",,,,,,"When possible, cross-checking of information between countries was used to improve assessment in countries where information was limited.  When several sources give different or contradictory figures, preference was always given to information collected at national or sub-national level.  This preference is based on the assumption that no regional information can be more accurate than studies carried out at the country level. Unless proven to be wrong, official rather than unofficial sources were used.  In the case of shared water resources, a comparison between countries was made to ensure consistency at river-basin level.",,,,,,"For more information, please refer to the following publication: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Water Resources, Development and Management Service. 2003.

Rome: FAO.",,,,,,Data Reliability:,,,"While AQUASTAT represents the most complete and careful compilation of water resources statistics to date, freshwater data are generally of poor quality.  Information sources are various but rarely complete.  Access to information on water resources is still sometimes restricted for reasons related to sensitivity at the regional level.  The accuracy and reliability of the information vary greatly among regions, countries, and categories of information, as does the year in which the information was gathered.  As a result, no consistency can be ensured at the regional level on the duration and dates of the period of reference.",,,,,,"For more information, please refer to the original data source, or to the 2003 print publication Review of World Water Resources by Country in FAO's AQUASTAT Programme.",,,

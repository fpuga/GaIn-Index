Available online at http://www.wssinfo.org/pdf/JMP_06.pdf.,,,,,,,,,Technical Notes,,,Definition: ,,,"Access to improved sanitation measures the total proportion of the population with access to improved sanitation facilities, expressed as a percentage.",,,,,,"Improved sanitation includes any of the following excreta disposal facilities: connection to a public sewer, connection to a septic tank, pour-flush latrine, simple pit latrine, ventilated improved pit latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet. Improved sanitation facilities are more likely to be sanitary than unimproved facilities, but are not a direct measure of 'basic' sanitation--facilities which are ""considered the lowest-cost options for safe, hygenic and convenient facilities that prevent the user and his or her immediate environment from coming into contact with human excreta."" ",,,,,,"A poor water supply and sanitation system can lead to a number of diseases, including diarrhoea, intestinal worms, and cholera. Examples of an unimproved sanitation system include: open pit latrines, public or shared latrines, service or bucket latrines (where excreta are manually removed), hanging latrines, flush to elsewhere (street, yard, open sewer, ditch, river, etc.), and no facilities.",,,,,,Years Covered and Frequency of Update:,,,"Data are for 1990 and 2004. These data were collected under the WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme and published in August, 2006. Updates to these data are made every few years.",,,,,,Methodology:,,,"Data presented here are based on over 500 nationally representative household surveys and national censuses. The majority of data are collected from Demographic Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Living Standards Measurement Studies (LSMS), and World Health Surveys (WHS). The houshold-level information collected by DHS and MICS shows the facilities that are actually being used, not just the facilities that have been installed. The surveys also measure self-built facilities installed by households and local communities. Population data used by WHO and UNICEF in computing percentage estimates come from the United Nations Population Division's World Population Prospects: The 2004 Revision. ",,,,,,"After data collection, survey and census data are plotted on a graph for each country to show coverage in available years (not necessarily 1990 and 2004). A best-fit trend line is drawn and extrapolated out to 1990 and 2004 (common reference years) to determine the amount of improved sanitation coverage.",,,,,,"WHO and UNICEF collaborate to track progress on global water and sanitation goals through the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP). The JMP monitors trends in coverage; helps build national monitoring capacity in developing countries; develops and harmonizes questionnaires, indicators and definitions to ensure comparability of data over time and among countries; and informs policy makers of the status of the water supply and sanitation sector worldwide through publications such as this one. The JMP draws guidance from a technical advisory group of leading experts in water supply, sanitation and hygiene, and from institutions involved in data collection and sector monitoring.",,,,,,Further information about the JMP and its methodology can be found at http://www.wssinfo.org. These data and additional information can also be found at http://www.childinfo.org.,,,,,,Data Reliability:,,,These data are the result of an intensive and concerted effort to arrive at the best possible estimates of the proportion of the population with improved sanitation facilities. The data have become more reliable as WHO and UNICEF have shifted from provider-based information (national census estimates) to consumer-based information (survey data).,,,,,,"Nonetheless, users of this data set should keep in mind that the data used to arrive at estimates of improved sanitation come from a wide variety of sources of disparate quality. Some countries have numerous sources of data covering the same period, allowing for cross-references, while other estimates are derived from many fewer sources of poor quality. Comparisons among countries should be made with care.",,,
